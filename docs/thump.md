# `.thump`
_throw errors instead of curbing them_

## Description
By default, for every [invocable method](../README.md#invocable-methods), all error-inducing scenarios' outcomes are predictable by taking a look at each method's `Edge Cases`. Use `.thump` if you would like a descriptive error to be thrown whenever anything goes wrong, instead of having the default behavior curb the error.
